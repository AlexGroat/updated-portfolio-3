# **Alex Groat Portfolio** #

# *Description* #

This is my updated porfolio page, it is developed with react which is a technology I have yet to use. I encountered multiple obstacles while trying to work with react and learnt quite a lot during the development.
The website is styled using CSS and flexbox; it also has a reponsive layout so it will adapt to all screen sizes.
